GTFO

`go get github.com/carbocation/go.gtfo`

Golang Threaded Forum, Opensource (GTFO), is a library that contains all of the 
necessary parts for building a threaded forum using golang and a 
database. http://askgolang.com uses this library as its source code.

To get started, take a look at the "example" directory. This example assumes
you are using OS X for development and Postgres as your database server. If so, 
you can create what is needed in Postgres with "example/forum.sql", and then 
you can compile the project from that path with ./compile.sh

The LICENSE specifies the terms, but essentially this is licensed under an MIT-style license.

Please report any issues to me here on Github.
