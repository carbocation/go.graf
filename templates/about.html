    <h1>{{.G.Site}}</h1>
    
    <p class="lead">{{.G.Site}} is a threaded discussion forum written in <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>.</p>
    
    <ul class="unstyled">
    <li><span class="label label-info">Recursive</span> {{.G.Site}} ranks each post or comment based not only on the upvotes and downvotes that 
    it has received, but also based on the score of all of its child comments (recursively down 
    the tree). The hypothesis is this will surface interesting discussion, even when the discussion 
    is sparked by low-value or even negative-value posts.</li>
    
    <li><span class="label label-info">Responsive</span> This site is also designed with reasonable amounts of responsiveness in mind. To that end, 
    the upvote and downvote buttons are much larger and more widely spaced than in the typical 
    news discussion forum.</li> 
    
    <li><span class="label label-info">Bcrypted</span> This site stores  
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">bcrypted</a> passwords. If 
    our database is ever compromised, your password is still protected by one 
    of the best password protection mechanisms available. As always, choosing a 
    high-entropy password is a good idea.</li>
    </ul>
