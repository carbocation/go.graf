Have a weight for each user. Their votes have that weight. Offline, 
calculate the value of their contributions to calculate this weight.
When you do SUM(upvotes), you instead do SUM(upvotes * weight)

Move $.document.ready() stuff into its own file.

Cache threads that are requested. Come up with a low-cost way to 
check to see if a tree element has been invalidated and re-load 
only if so. Consider a global cache of posts and their votes, with 
per-user cache of vote status on each post. Now that you pull down 
all posts for the front page, this is even more important.

Add flash cookie if your login failed. Redirect to login form on 
failed login. Redirect to target page on successful login. 

Create view forms of each struct. They will incorporate the data 
form by composition, e.g.: type ViewEntry { Entry, Points int64 }
Note ^ Might just want to create smarter getters and setters for 
the structs, and declare the complete set of data on the structs 
that you might want, but only populate/access what is needed.
And, you know, cache stuff.

Probably want to create a standardized way of passing data to 
the templates. You probably want 2+ fields:
  1: Global context. This contains sitewide global vales. 
  2: Session context. This contains user-specific values for the 
  current session.
Then, every _base template can depend on both of those being present, 
so you will not break them by accidentally leaving one of those two out, 
and you will not create _base templates that include something outside
that scope. 

Redirect requests coming to /thread/1 to /thread/1/title-of-thread 
programmatically always. If it's an error, redirect to an error page.

When registration fails and you pre-populate the form again for the user, 
show the posted form values instead of modifying the User struct, because 
when you modify the user struct the screen says "Logged in as {desired username}" 
at the top right. Bad!
